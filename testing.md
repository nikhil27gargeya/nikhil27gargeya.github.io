# Testing

Basic: could use std::time and compute the difference between the start and end of a function or an entire program

Unit Testing:
Arrange, Act, Assert
Arrange: Initial setup, only test one change (isolate from other changes)
Act: Execute some state change
Assert: Assert that the result is what we expect

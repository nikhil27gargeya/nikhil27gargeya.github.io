# OOP

OOP: Software design organized through objects rather than functions

Classes and Objects:
Class: User defined data type that acts as a blueprint for class instances, which are called objects
Object: Instance of a class with specific data

Methods and Attributes:
Methods: Action that an object can perform
Attributes: Data

Encapsulation:
A class is a unit that has methods and attributes as a part of it. This class exposes specific data using access specifiers.

Abstraction:
Simpliifed classes over complex implementation code (ie. ignition switch vs engine mechanics)

Inheritance:
With inheritance, classes automatically inhabit the same properties and functionalities as their parent class. This functionality can be modified and/or extended.

Polymorphism:
Uniform treatment of classes in a class hierarchy. Allows the same code to be used with different objects and behave differently with each.

Containership/Composition:
Using an object within another.

Class Relationships:

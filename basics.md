# Basics:

Language: tool to write code
Library: prewritten codebase that is a piece in the build
Framework: Blueprint on which your code functions on

Software exists within a framework
Software contains libraries

Code calls a library vs. Framework calls code

Strongly vs Weakly Typed:
Strongly Typed: type rules are enforced by the compiler. Error will be thrown if there are operations between incompatible types. Explicit conversions are required in most cases. (ie. python, java, c(has some implicit conversion, like int -> long bc no loss in precision), swift(has no implicit conversion))
Weakly Typed: type rules are not enforced by the compiler. Implicit/type conversions. (ie. javascript, php)

Statically vs Dynamically Typed:
Statically Typed: type rules are enforced at compile time, the compiler type checks at runtime (ie. java, c, swift)
Dynamically Typed: type rules are enforced at run time (ie. javascript, python)

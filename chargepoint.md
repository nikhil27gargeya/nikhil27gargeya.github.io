# Chargepoint

Power Management Algorithms:
FIFO: allow power modules based on car order, first vehicle gets all the power it can take, next gets leftover power
Equal Share: second vehicle gets half of available power
Fixed Allocation: number of modules assigned to stations are fixed

Swing Arms: keep cables off the groun
Status light: shows status of the charging station

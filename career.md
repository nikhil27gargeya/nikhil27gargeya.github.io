# Career

I have always been interested in mobile apps and human computer interaction. I had a keen interest in user experience design, and I honed my skills in clear, intuitive, designs. While in college, I was an active member of Hack4Impact, a student led organization that develops software for nonprofits. I contributed to several MERN stack projects that emphasized accessibility and social impact experiences that deepened my interest in building meaningful, mission driven tools.
I have previously interned at Cargill Inc. and Xenovus Inc., where I contributed to their design and frontend teams. At Xenovus, I built several frontend web components which resulted in a UX overhaul and the system was deployed across major clients including Boeing and New York Life. In parallel, I designed and developed SharedT ab, an iOS app for managing group expenses while traveling. This personal project has allowed me to dive deeply into mobile
UI patterns, backend integration and large language models. I am especially excited about the intersection of health and technology, and I am eager to apply my skills towards building products that improve lives.

I recently graduated from the University of Southern California with a degree in Cognitive Science and Computer Science, where I focused on human computer interaction and built strong foundations in programming. My interdisciplinary background enables me
to approach engineering challenges with a user focused mindset and a hands on, iterative approach to building. 

I had an interest in working at the intersection of health and technology. I studied Cognitive Science for its interdisciplinary nature, and being able to understand the link between mind subareas and how humans think and intereact with products.

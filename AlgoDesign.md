# Algorithm Design

Algorithm: procedure that takes any of the possible input instances and transforms it to the desired output

An algorithmic problem is specified by describing the input space (complete set of instances) it must work on and the desired output for each instance. So, a problem is the general task, and the instance is a specific input of the problem.

3 desirable properties of a good algorithm
Correct, Efficient, Easy to implement

Correct algorithms need a proof of correctness.

# Biology Review

3 domains of organisms:
Archaea:
prokaryotic cell, lack membrane bound nucleus, tough cell wall allowing them to exist in extreme conditions (hot springs, ocean)
Bacteria: prokaryotic cell, lacks membrane bound nucleus 
Eukarya: has nucleus, can be unicellular or multicellular (ie. fungi, protists, complex organisms), some eukarya have a cell wall, some don't (4 subfamilies are protista, fungi, plantae, animalia)

Prokaryotic organisms belong either to the domain Archaea or the domain Bacteria; organisms with eukaryotic cells belong to the domain Eukarya.

Cell Wall: present in plants, made of peptidoglycan in bacteria, chitin in fungi, and cellulose in plants, 
Cell Membrane/Plasma Membrane: lipid bilayer, present in all living cells

Prokaryotic Cell Structure:

Eukaryotic Cell Structure:

Nuclear Evnelope: a membrane barrier that separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm in Eukaryotic cells

Meiosis: process in which a single cell divides twice to form 4 haploid daughter cells, used to producing gametes (sex cells). So one cell -> 4 gametes (sperm or egg). Each of the haploid cells has one chromatid (23) whereas diploid has two sets of chromatids (46).
Process includes separating homologous chromosomes (phase 1) and sister chromatids (phase 2)

Interphase (time for chromosome duplication):
Centromere: area where the spindle fibers
Spindle fibers: proteins that separate sister chromatids

Prophase 1: 
Chromosomes condense, nuclear envelope fragments. Spindle fibers emerge from the centrosomes.

Prometaphase 1:
Homologous chromosomes attach to the spindle fibers. 

Metaphase 1:
Homologous chromosomes randomly assemble at the metaphase plate.

Anaphase 1:
Spindle fibers pull the chromosomes apart

Telophase 1:
Sister chromatids are at either side of the cell. Nuclear envelope forms around each cell.

Cytokinesis:
Result is two haploid cells.

Prophase 2:
Sister chromatids condense, nuclear envelope fragments. New spindle form.

Cytokinesis:
Result is four haploid cells.

DNA: deoxyribonucleic acid
repeating units of sugar deoxyribose and phosphate linked to 4 bases: A, T, C, G
Copying mistake = Mutation

Mitosis: cell division producing two identical daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes (46). If cells don't have the full set of chromosomes, they can cause cancer or just die.

Once difference between Meiosis and Mitosis is the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells (23 for daughter gamete cells, 46 for daughter cells of mitosis). Also, mitosis does not separate homologous chromosomes like in meiosis 1 but rather separates sister chromatids.

DNA replication:
Initiation (enzymes are recruited to sites along the DNA sequence) -> Elongation (assembly of the daughter DNA strands) -> Termination (signaled by stop sequence in DNA)
